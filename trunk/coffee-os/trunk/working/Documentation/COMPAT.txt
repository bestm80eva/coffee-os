for lazarus application framework compatibility in FUTURE we need:

dos[fileops],crt[video] --done already.

classes,windows units (or a interface to our windows units.THis is lacking so far.)
[at least.]

[windows unit can be either emulated to t or Gvision style(RECOMMENDED) or built from scratch.]

this is unless you want to write all your apps with tvision. the interface can only get so good.

we DO use freevision for this, but without borland code.
we do this in tvision by default anyway. it just looks like ass in console mode with video unit.
