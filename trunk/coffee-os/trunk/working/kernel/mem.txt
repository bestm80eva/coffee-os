Pascal:(memory access)

Manipulating the byte directly:

VAR B: Byte;

Its still best to think of the bits as being numbered from 0
to 7.  To test if bit 2 is set simply use:  

[BTS/BTC in asm]

If (B and 2)<>0 Then ...(if bt is set)

To set bit 2, use:  B := B or (1 shl 2);
To clear bit 2, use:  B := B and NOT(1 shl 2); 

if (b and 8) = 0 then (if bit not set)
   { bit clear }
else
   { bit set }
